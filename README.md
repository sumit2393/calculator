# String Calculator (TDD with Flutter & Provider)

## Getting Started

A simple String Calculator implemented using Test-Driven Development (TDD).
The project demonstrates clean separation of business logic and UI using Flutter
and Provider for state management.

## Problem Statement
The String Calculator accepts a string of numbers and returns their sum.
It supports multiple delimiters, newline-separated values, and validates
negative numbers by throwing descriptive exceptions.

## Features
- Add numbers from a string input
- Supports unlimited numbers
- Supports newline (`\n`) as a delimiter
- Supports custom delimiters (e.g. `//;\n1;2`)
- Throws exception for negative numbers
- Displays all negative numbers in error message
- Clean UI built with Flutter
- State management using Provider
- Business logic fully unit-tested (TDD)

## Tech-Stack
- Flutter
- Dart
- Provider (State Management)
- flutter_test (Unit & Widget Testing)

## 🧪 Test-Driven Development (TDD)
1. Wrote failing unit tests for each requirement
2. Implemented the minimum logic to pass the test
3. Refactored while keeping tests green
4. Repeated for each new feature

## ▶️ Run the App
flutter pub get
flutter run

## 🧪 Run Tests
flutter test
